Luffy that wants to set sail on an adventure to make his own crew and become the next pirate king. On his way doing so he makes comrades and turns even his enemies into allies when they all helped him in the Marineford War when he went to save his brother alongside the strongest pirate of the era Whitebeard. However along with his allies and his strength they were unable to save his brother Ace and he saw his brother's death right before his eyes. Due to this and as Luffy had potential the pirate kings right hand man Silvers Rayleigh ended up training Luffy over two years to teach him the stages of haki and make him stronger. After the two year time skip Luffy and his crew reunited and they set off to continue their adventure where they went into the New World and made more enemies coming up against tougher oppenents. The recent highlights of the post time skip is the fight to save the country of Dressrosa from an emperor of the sea Donquixote Doflamingo as he was using it's labs as a drug factory to duplicate devil fruits. After that is where Kaido and his crew are introduced but the story takes a turn to ano emperor of the sea, Big Mom where the crew goes to bring back the member Sanji and take down Big Mom as she was using Sanji's marriage as a way to attack the Vinsmoke family and take over their land. And with that, the adventure continues into the Wano Arc, where Luffy has been announced to become the fifth emperor of the sea after defeating Big Mom. The reason they're going to the Land of Wano is to challenge aanother emperor of the sea named Kaido, to put an end to his devil fruit trafficking business. </p>

Afterwards, like Zoro he was undercover in the Land of Wano waiting for Luffy's arrival and he's the brains behind making the plan on attacking Kaido. Like Luffy he has the name 'D.' in his name. He has the power of the Ope Ope no Mi, a devil fruit which allows him to create a sphere of light blue aura, inside which he can manipulate the fabric of space.

Like Kaido she's known for her monstrous strength and her pirate hat which transforms into a giant sword she uses in battle and her flame that is always around her which is called Prometheus that shoots out blasts of flames and fuses with Big Mom by turning her hair into flames which intimidates the opponents and adds onto her body being untouchable. Her devil fruit was the Soru Soru no mi devil fruit which enabled her to take the souls of people who fear her and also allows her to put her soul into objects and create weapons from them. As of now she's formed an alliance with the "Strongest Creature" Kaido in order to become a strong pirate crew just like how they were on the same crew years ago.

          Shanks also referred to as "Red Haired" Shanks is one of the four emperors of the seas who does not have a devil fruit and he doesn't want to eat one because if you eat a devil fruit you lose the ability to swim. He's the leader of the Red Hair Pirates and inspiration for Luffy to wanting to become a pirate. His intentions are unknown but he did stop the Marineford War by challenging the Marines in a battle, but they stepped back showing how much him and his crew are feared and the Marines ended the war there. Like Luffy, Shanks has the conqueror's haki making him in somewhat way overpowered, especially the fact that he doesn't have a devil fruit.

        <p>
          Marshall D. Teach, now known as Blackbeard is now a fourth emperor of the sea taking over Whitbeard's role. Blackbeard has two devil fruits, one being his own which is the Yami Yami no Mi which allows him to use dark matter and he then stole Whitebeards devil fruit, the Gura Gura no Mi and abuses its power and took over Whitebeards territories and claimed Whitebeard's role as an emperor of the sea. The surprising thing is how Blackbeard survived eating two devil fruits because it shouldn't be possible but he didn't eat it, he used his devil fruit power to absorb it and with that he gained its powers. Due to him taking over Whitebeards territory, he is now an emperor of the sea alongside Kaido, Big Mom and Shanks. His intention currently is to find the One Piece in order to become the pirate king unlike Luffy who has a different method of reaching his goal, therefore Blackbeard is the counter of Luffy as Blackbeard is evil and like stealing Whitebeard's devil fruit, he will most likely abuse the role of being pirate king.

        <h1>Gol D. Roger</h1>
        <img src="img/roger2.jpg" alt="roger" />
        <p>
          Gol D. Roger also called "Gold Roger" was the pirate king and the only one who held the title and obtained the legendary treasure called "One Piece". Like Shanks Roger didn't have a devil fruit but had the conqueror's haki which is what he relied on when going into battles along with his crew members and his trusty right hand man and first mate Silvers Rayleigh. He made all his enemies inferior in front of him including the Marines where Admiral Garp was his rival even though there was a point in time where Garp asked Roger for his help on taking down the Rock Pirates. Sadly he caught an uncurable disease and knew he would die soon but still went on with his pirate adventures and disbanded with his crew in the end and handed himself into the Marines to get executed. Before he died he announced that he's hidden the One Piece somewhere before handing himself in and said that whoever finds it will have everything he ever owned and his words inspired many pirates all over the world.
